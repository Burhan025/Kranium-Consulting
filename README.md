In this project, I have implemented a custom WordPress child theme by setting up localization, custom navigation, breadcrumbs, and widgets. Enhanced performance by optimizing scripts and styles, enabled AMP features, shortcodes, RSS image feeds, and custom post excerpts. Designed dynamic headers, footers, and theme customizations.
